0.  BMP supports over 4 billion colors, PNG and JPEG both support around 16 million, GIF supports 256.
1.  GIF supports animation.
2.  Lossy compression discards parts of the data to have a smaller compressed file. Lossless compression does not degrade the image and
preserves the image quality.
3.  JPEG is lossy.
4.  The first character in the FAT file's directory entry is modified. The FAT clusters are moved to the hard drive's list of free clusters.
5.  You can use a sanitization tool to overwrite over your existing data.
6.  Stdint declares types of integers of a certain length (number of bytes).
7.  They specify the number of bytes (8, 32, or 16) you want to free up for a certain type of data, and whether the integer is signed or unsigned.
8.  Byte is 1, dword and long are 4, word is 2.
9.  The first 2 bytes are a "WORD" represented by 424d in hexadecimal. 424d -> "BM"
10. BiSize is size in bytes of the entire structure, while bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file.
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down bitmap and begins in the upper right corner.
12. biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel.
13. If the output file for the program to write to cannot be opened.
14. This third argument is the number of elements you want to read from the file. Since you want to read one element at a time, this argument is 1.
15. It assigns a value of 3 to padding.
16. Fseek skips over the padding, if any.
17. It specifies the offset in "fseek" as relative to the current position.
18. Rick Astley?
