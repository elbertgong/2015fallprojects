My project allows two people to play chess against each other. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess.

First, log into the ide. Start up apache50 with its root in /workspace/finalproject/public. Then visit the site at https://ide50-elbertgong.cs50.io. To start a game of chess, press play. You will be taken to a chessboard. White moves first. Have the white player select the square with the piece they want to move and the square that they want to move it to. If white wants to play pawn to E4, they would select "E2" as original square and "E4" as destination square. When the move has been selected, press the "submit move for approval by the gangster overlords" button, which will determine whether or not the move is legal. If the move is legal, the chessboard will now reflect the updated position of the piece. After  white moves once, it is black's turn to move. Black selects a piece to move in the same way, and then submits the move for approval. The game proceeds until the user clicks the "click here when game is over" button. This takes you to a page where you have the option of starting up a new game.
